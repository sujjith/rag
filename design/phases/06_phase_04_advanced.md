# Phase 4: Advanced RAG Techniques

### Phase 4: Advanced - Expert Python

**Python Concepts You'll Learn:**
- Metaclasses and descriptors
- Custom decorators with arguments
- Performance profiling (cProfile)
- Memory optimization
- Plugin architecture
- Protocol classes (structural typing)
- Concurrent.futures
- Context variables

| Task | Priority | Python Concepts | Status |
|------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Hybrid search | Medium | Protocol classes, composition | Pending |
| Document-level ACL | Medium | Permission decorators, middleware | Pending |
| Conversation history | Low | State management, sessions | Pending |
| Additional connectors | Low | ABC, Factory pattern, plugins | Pending |
| PII detection | Low | Regex, streaming, generators | Pending |
| A/B testing framework | Low | Random, statistics, decorators | Pending |
| Performance optimization | Low | cProfile, memory_profiler | Pending |

**Milestone Project**: Extensible, high-performance RAG system.

### Learning Checkpoints

After each phase, you should be able to answer these questions:

**Phase 1 Checkpoint:**
- [ ] What's the difference between `list` and `generator`?
- [ ] Why use type hints?
- [ ] How do context managers work?
- [ ] What is `__init__.py` for?

**Phase 2 Checkpoint:**
- [ ] How does dependency injection improve testability?
- [ ] What's the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`?
- [ ] How do you mock external services in tests?
- [ ] What's the purpose of Pydantic validators?

**Phase 3 Checkpoint:**
- [ ] When should you use async vs threading vs multiprocessing?
- [ ] How does SQLAlchemy manage database sessions?
- [ ] What's the difference between Factory and Strategy patterns?
- [ ] How does Redis caching improve performance?

**Phase 4 Checkpoint:**
- [ ] When would you use metaclasses?
- [ ] How do you profile Python code for bottlenecks?
- [ ] What's structural typing (Protocols)?
- [ ] How do you design a plugin system?
