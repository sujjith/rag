    "# Phase 3.1: Registering Models in MLflow Model Registry\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "1. **Training and Logging a Model** - Build and track a model\n",
    "2. **Model Registration** - Register models in the Model Registry\n",
    "3. **Adding Descriptions** - Document your models\n",
    "4. **Auto-Registration** - Register during logging\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Model Registry?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Model Registry** is MLflow's central hub for managing the full lifecycle of ML models. Think of it as a \"model database\" where you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Store** different versions of your models\n",
    "- **Track** which models are in production\n",
    "- **Document** what each model does\n",
    "- **Compare** different model versions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Model Registry?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Without Registry | With Registry |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------|\n",
    "| Models scattered in folders | Centralized model storage |\n",
    "| No version tracking | Full version history |\n",
    "| Manual deployment | Stage-based deployment |\n",
    "| No documentation | Rich model metadata |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "- Understand what the Model Registry is\n",
    "- Learn to register models from runs\n",
    "- Know how to add descriptions to models\n",
    "- Use auto-registration during logging"
